**FizikUm** is a 3D simulation designed to help students from 7th to 12th grade (for Bulgaria) understand and experiment with electrical circuits. Created using **Unity**, this application offers an engaging and interactive learning experience that promotes a deeper understanding of electrical concepts.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features:
- **3D Interactive Grid (Matrix):** The simulation takes place on a dynamic grid (matrix) where users can place electrical components such as cables, batteries, lightbulbs, and switches.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Every time an element is placed on the grid, a recursive algorithm updates all the items adjacent to the modified element, reflecting how electrical circuits would function in the real world.
- **Custom 3D Models:** All 3D models used in the simulation are original and meticulously crafted in **Blender** to provide a realistic and educational experience.
